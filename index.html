  <div class="body">
    <br>
    <p>This past June, galvanized by nationwide protests following the death of George Floyd, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a series of reforms which included legislation criminalizing chokeholds and repealing section 50-a of the Civil Rights Law, a
      statute which has kept police disciplinary records concealed from the public.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In New York, the use of chokeholds is at the heart of debates about officers’ use of force. In 2014, NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo killed Eric Garner with a chokehold. Garner’s dying words –– ”I can’t breathe” –– ignited a national outcry
      against police brutality.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Though chokeholds have been officially banned by the NYPD since 1993, their use has continued. While citizens could file complaints about officers’ excessive use of force with the Civilian Complaint Review Board, section 50-a made it nearly
      impossible to know what disciplinary action was taken, if any, as a result. Though the CCRB has the authority to investigate allegations of police misconduct, it has no power to enforce discipline: the Police Department retains discretion over
      what disciplinary measures are ultimately imposed.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Upon the repeal of section 50-a, the New York Civil Liberties Union successfully filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the records. In August, they published a database making public over 300,000 NYPD misconduct allegations dating
      back to before 1985.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The release of the records was a milestone for the police accountability movement. “It’s huge,” said Carol Archbold, chair and professor in the department of criminal justice at North Dakota State University. “You know, when you're less
      forthcoming and less willing to give this information out, it just really calls into question the reason why. What's being hidden here?”</p>
    <br>
    <p>The data describes allegations of police misconduct categorized by force, abuse of authority, discourtesy, or offensive language. Of the use of force allegations, nearly 2,000, ranging from 1997 to 2020, reported use of a chokehold.</p>
    <br>
    <p>However, only 84 of these 1,746 allegations were substantiated by the CCRB, a rate of about 5%. It’s important to note that there are many reasons allegations are not substantiated, such as withdrawal of the complaint or insufficient evidence.
      It does not necessarily mean the complaints were without merit.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The data reflects a national trend. Nationwide, “usually under 10% of complaints are actually sustained,” Archbold said. “You're lucky if you get double digits.”</p><br>

      <script type="text/javascript">
        ! function() {
          "use strict";
          window.addEventListener("message", (function(a) {
            if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"])
              for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
                var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']");
                t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px")
              }
          }))
        }();
      </script>

    </div>

    <br>
    <p>“As far as looking at those that are sustained, there's very few of those that actually received some kind of punishment,” Archbold added. “In the instances when it is taken, it has to be where it's very serious offenses. And the punishment
      doesn't always match up with the seriousness of the offense or the misconduct.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>This pattern is borne out in the data. Of the 84 allegations the CCRB found to be substantiated, only one resulted in termination. The Police Department did not impose any penalty for about 43% of the allegations. For about 36% of allegations,
      the Police Department elected to impose disciplinary actions that ranged from instruction to loss of vacation days.</p><br>
